# build-and-deploy-canary-service

This service is used by the Build and Deploy team to test the build and deployment of a scala service into an environment.

This `labs` branch is targetted by the canary pipeline in build. Please don't delete it.

## Requirements

* AdoptOpenJDK Java 1.8.0_272
* sbt - version defined in [build.properties](./project/build.properties)

## Updating dependencies and sbt

To find dependencies that may need to be updated and the latest sbt version, the [Tax Platform Catalogue](https://catalogue.tax.service.gov.uk/repositories/build-and-deploy-canary-service) will show outdated dependencies and sbt version for the running service.

For sbt version see [build.properties](./project/build.properties)

For service dependencies see [AppDependencies.scala](./project/AppDependencies.scala)

For sbt plugins see [plugins.sbt](./project/plugins.sbt)

After updating either the sbt version, sbt plugins, or service dependencies confirm the service compiles and tests pass with:

    sbt clean test

## Smoke testing configuration

In order to confirm that platform tooling is properly passing configuration items to microservices, we check for the presence of various configuration items on launch. If any of these configuration items are missing, an exception will be thrown.

```yaml
environment:
    SERVICE_WILL_FAIL_TO_START_WITHOUT_THIS_ENV_VAR: "value not important"

hmrc_config:
    service.will.fail.to.start.without.this.sys.prop: "value not important"
```

You can simulate the failure of a microservice bootstrap by removing any of these values from configuration and performing a deployment.
